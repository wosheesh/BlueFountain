# BlueFountain - Synopsis
A simple script to scrape the Alumni database of my alma mater

## Motivation
In my profession I rely a lot on a good network, and my MBA school provided me with access to a worldwide community of great people. However the online database is an antique in terms of accessibility. The search results are not accessible in a convenient way, sorting is almost non-exisiting. Especially for countries with thousands of Alumni browsing the db is horrific. So I decided to just copy the most important information by building a scrape script in python

## Code example
This is a very simple python script that uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup


## Installation
The script relies on a local firefox profile to login to this particular database. So it's not wrapped in an installer.

## Tests
No idea.

## Contributors
Thanks to the StackOverflow community - wouldn't have figured out the issue with selenium authentication and clicking javascript links without them
